Myself in 2020

A Short Introduction
My Name is Catarina Simone Neves Costa and I am from Duncan, South Carolina. I am 16 years old and currently reside in Duncan with my mom, dad, brother, two dogs, two guinea pigs, and cat. I work at an americanized Mexican restaurant whenever I can. I am also a former dancer and pageant girl. I go to school at USC Upstate for the Scholars Academy.

My Family
My mom and I are extremely close, and I am always proud to say that she is like my best friend. She always gives me the best advice and I can never thank her enough for always being there for me. My dad is very outgoing and social, unlike me. He can embarrass me a lot of the time but I know he does it because he loves me. My brother is about two years younger than me and can be a pain sometimes but that's just what siblings do. My dogs' names are Gwen and Kaya and they are an Australian Shepard mix and a German Shepard. Gwen is almost ten years old and Kaya is almost a year old, so the difference in personalities is huge. My brother takes care of the guinea pigs but their names are Cookie and Athena and they are a mother and daughter pair. Lastly, my cat's name is Dharma and she is a black American shorthair cat. 

Dance and Pageantry
I was a dancer up until January of this year (2021). I decided to quit because I did not love dancing anymore. Instead of being excited to go to dance, it ended up feeling like a chore and I would always hate going. The dance studio I went to also became an extremely toxic place and I did not want to have to deal with it. I did pageants constantly when I was nine up until I was about thirteen. Over that time I was able to accumulate over four thousand community service hours and two national pageant titles. My favorite part about pageants is how involved they can be within a community. I really enjoyed doing community service and helping those in need. I now only do the high school pageant just for fun.

School/Education
The Scholars Academy is a program for all Spartanburg county school districts and it allows high school students to take college classes and earn college credits while still in high school. This process starts in the eighth grade when someone can apply and go do an interview to see if they are the right person for the program. In ninth grade is when that person begins taking college classes and this program continues throughout all of high school. Not only am I in this program, but I am also in a scholarship program called the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation. This foundation supplies high school students with school supplies and anything they need for school. It is a great foundation and they are extremely supportive with anything that the students want to do. I have an educational advisor who helps me with picking classes and now is helping me with looking at colleges. It is a super great foundation and it has helped me a lot.
